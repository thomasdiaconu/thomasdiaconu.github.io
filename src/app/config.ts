        I’m a sofware engineer based in Paris. I currently work at AWS, in the mainframe modernization Blu Age service.
        I focus on automating mainframe modernization code, to deliver custom reliable modern code.
        <br><br>
        Beyond software engineering, I have a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence, and I’m looking forward to exploring this field further. 
        I believe AI has the potential to change the world, and I’m excited to contribute to its growth.

        When I’m not coding, you’ll find me enjoying tennis, participating in competitive programming, playing video games, or simply spending quality time with my children.
