        I’m a sofware engineer based in Paris. I currently work at AWS, in the mainframe modernization Blu Age service.
        I focus on automating mainframe modernization code, to deliver custom with reliable modern code.
        <br><br>
        Beyond software engineering, I have a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence, and I’m eager to explore this field further. I firmly believe that AI has the potential to change the world, and I’m excited to contribute to its growth.
        <br><br>
        Teaching is another passion of mine. Whether it’s guiding students in mathematics or introducing them to the fundamentals of computer science, I find immense satisfaction in sharing knowledge and inspiring others to learn.
        <br><br>
        When I’m not coding or teaching, you’ll likely find me on the tennis court, participating in competitive programming, or enjoying video games. Most importantly, I treasure spending quality time with my wife and children, who bring joy and balance to my life.
