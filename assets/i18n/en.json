    "introduction": "I am a sofware engineer based in Paris. I currently work at AWS, in the mainframe modernization Blu Age service. I focus on automating mainframe modernization code, to deliver custom with reliable modern code.\n\n Beyond software engineering, I have a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence, and I’m eager to explore this field further. I firmly believe that AI has the potential to change the world, and I’m excited to contribute to its growth.\n\n Teaching is another passion of mine. Whether it’s guiding students in mathematics or introducing them to the fundamentals of computer science, I find immense satisfaction in sharing knowledge and inspiring others to learn.\n\nWhen I’m not coding or teaching, you’ll likely find me on the tennis court, participating in competitive programming, or enjoying video games. Most importantly, I treasure spending quality time with my wife and children, who bring joy and balance to my life.",
